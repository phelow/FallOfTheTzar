IMPORTANT: Upgrading? See the Upgrade Notes below!


Getting Started:
----------------
o Read the documentation (see below).
o Play the scene Assets/Dialogue System/Examples/Feature Demo/Feature Demo.


Documentation:
--------------
o Online documentation is accessible through the menu Window > Dialogue System > Help.
  A copy of the documentation is included in a zip file in the Documentation folder for offline use.
  Do NOT unzip it into your Assets folder! It contains Doxygen-generated JavaScript files; if these
  are in the Assets folder, Unity will try to compile them and fail. If you want an offline copy of
  the documentation, unzip it outside of your Assets folder.
